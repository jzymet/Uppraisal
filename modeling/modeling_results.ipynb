    "## Modeling results\n",
    "\n",
    "Brief notebook giving the results for the baseline linear regression model, full linear model, and a Lasso (i.e., linear model with L1 prior) with the same features as the full model. Print validation metric results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model coefficients of the features mirror the findings of the data exploration:\n",
    "- Including the laptop's storage capacity in the title/description results in price gains\n",
    "- Including the laptop's screen size in the title/description results in price gains\n",
    "- Including the laptop's manufacture year in the title/description generally results in a small loss (see data exploration for more discussion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative to the specs-only baseline, the full model scores 20 points lower on RMSE and 3.5% higher on R-squared, suggesting that these text-based features really are predictive of price, and that sellers should approach title and description creation strategically."
