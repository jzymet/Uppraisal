# Data exploration

My exploration of used MacBook Pro listings yielded the following general results, in summary:
- Including the laptop's storage capacity in the title/description results in price gains, and the effect is strongest when storage capacity is high
- Including the laptop's screen size in the title/description results in price gains
- Including the laptop's manufacture year in the title/description generally results in a small loss, and the loss is most consistently observed in older laptops

The results also reveal something of a hierarchy between the title and description, with effect sizes being larger for title improvements than for description.
